    Upload CSV files to AmCAT.

    To tell AmCAT which columns from the csv file to use, you need to specify the name in the file
    for the AmCAT-fields that you want to import. So, if you have a 'title' column in the csv file
    that you want to import as the headline, specify 'title' in the "headline field" input box.

    Text and date and required, all other fields are optional.

    If you are encountering difficulties, please make sure that you know how the csv is exported, and
    manually set encoding and dialect in the options above.

    Since Excel has quite some difficulties with exporting proper csv, it is often better to use
    an alternative such as OpenOffice or Google Spreadsheet (but see below for experimental xlsx support).
    If you must use excel, there is a 'tools' button on the save dialog which allows you to specify the
    encoding and delimiter used.

    We have added experimental support for .xlsx files (note: only use .xlsx, not the older .xls file type).
    This will hopefully alleviate some of the problems with reading Excel-generated csv file. Only the
    first sheet will be used, and please make sure that the data in that sheet has a header row. Please let
    us know if you encounter any difficulties at github.com/amcat/amcat/issues. Since you can only attach
    pictures there, the best way to share the file that you are having difficulty with (if it is not private)
    is to upload it to dropbox or a file sharing website and paste the link into the issue.
