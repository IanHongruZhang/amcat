*Caution: AmCAT3 is free academic software.* Please make
sure that you do not rely solely on AmCAT for storing your data or for
meeting critical deadlines. Please report any bugs or other issues on
our issue tracker: http://github.com/amcat/amcat/issues

We are working on creating user documentation for AmCAT as a wiki:
http://wiki.amcat.nl . This will be updated as we work
on the documentation. Consider subscribing to our user mailing list
(http://groups.google.com/group/amcat-user). This list will be used
for announcements from us on new versions or downtime, and you can
also use this list for asking user questions.

AmCAT is open source and all contributions are welcome! The full
source code can be downloaded from our our github page
(http://github.com/amcat/amcat). 

Good luck and kind regards,
The AmCAT team
